Test the site locally:
  hugo server
  browser http://localhost:1313
  Note that changes are automatically reloaded into the browser when testing this way.

Stage the site ready to be published live:
  ./build.sh
  The above clears the docs folder and runs hugo to rebuild the site. This is done because the
  hugo commend does not delete file from the docs folder, so will not clear any dead wood.

The above will build the site into the /docs folder, which is what github will use to publish the site.
You can test the staged site locally after the hugo command by running:
  cd docs
  http-server -c-1
  browser: http://localhost:8080

NOTE:
When commiting page changes to Git, don't just run git add -A as this will add all of the temporary files too!
Only add the files that have changed e.g.
  git add content/post
  git add assets

When pushing a change to the published site, run:
  ./build.sh
  git add /docs
  git commit -m ...
  git push origin main
  
If you do want to push the source changes at the same time as the published site, then remember to run ./build.sh
BEFORE git status and git add -A else you'll end up with loads of temp files in /docs !!
