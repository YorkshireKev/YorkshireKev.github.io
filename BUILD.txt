Test the site locally:
  hugo server
  browser http://localhost:1313
  Note that changes are automatically reloaded into the browser when testing this way.

Stage the site ready to be published live:
  ./build.sh
  The above clears the docs folder and runs hugo to rebuild the site. This is done because the
  hugo commend does not delete file from the docs folder, so will not clear any dead wood.

The above will build the site into the /docs folder, which is what github will use to publish the site.
You can test the staged site locally after the hugo command by running:
  cd docs
  http-server -c-1
  browser: http://localhost:8080
