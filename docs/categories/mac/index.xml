      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently switched to a MacBook Pro as my daily driver. One of the first things I noticed was that there was no maximise button on application windows, only a fullscreen option that hides the top status-bar. A quick google search told me that double clicking the title-bar or holing down ALT while clicking in the Green Icon would maximise the window instead of making it go fullscreen. Which is great! only it isn&amp;rsquo;t :(&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What that actually does is make the window wide enough for it&amp;rsquo;s content, but that does not usually mean full screen width.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
