      <description>One of the very first games I ever played on a home computer was a maze game called Labyrinth on the Sinclair ZX81. So when I wanted to learn Golang and delve a little deeper into terminal cli development, I decided to start with a simple maze game that could be run in a shell on the Linux command line.&#xA;As you can see from the screenshot, the graphics could, at best, be describes as very basic.</description>

      <description>One of my all-time favourite games is Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum. When Bug-Byte released Matthew Smith&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece in 1983 the bar was raised for quality gaming on the Speccy. Sure there were many, many excellent games released on the Spectrum (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Ultimate) but Manic Miner is still my go-to game when I need a retro gaming fix.&#xA;Ever since I saw Mario64 on the N64 I wondered what a 3D version of Manic Miner or Jet Set Willy would look and play like.</description>

      <description>Most of my recent (and not so recent) programming efforts have been in JavaScript that runs in the browser. I believed that with WebGL, the browser would become more relevant in gaming and graphics applications. Fast forward a few years and it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the vast majority of PC games are still downloaded and installed, just as they were decades ago.&#xA;I decided to return to creating native games for the PC.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with the html canvas element recently by writing some simple 2D games. One challenge is making a canvas based game fit nicely on the screen given the vast variety in browser resolutions. 2D games tend to be made up of images and I found that scaling these images so that they fill the browser window was both slow and ugly.&#xA;This got me thinking about WebGL. Is it possible to use a 3D WebGL library to render a 2D game and gain the scaling and performance advantages of the GPU?</description>
