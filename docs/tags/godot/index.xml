      <description>One of my all-time favourite games is Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum. When Bug-Byte released Matthew Smith&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece in 1983 the bar was raised for quality gaming on the Speccy. Sure there were many, many excellent games released on the Spectrum (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Ultimate) but Manic Miner is still my go-to game when I need a retro gaming fix.&#xA;Ever since I saw Mario64 on the N64 I wondered what a 3D version of Manic Miner or Jet Set Willy would look and play like.</description>

      <description>Most of my recent (and not so recent) programming efforts have been in JavaScript that runs in the browser. I believed that with WebGL, the browser would become more relevant in gaming and graphics applications. Fast forward a few years and it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the vast majority of PC games are still downloaded and installed, just as they were decades ago.&#xA;I decided to return to creating native games for the PC.</description>
