title: Useful VS Code Keyboard Combinations
url: /useful-vscode-keyboard-combinations/
---
These are a bunch of VS Code editing keyboard combinations that I find useful, but often struggle to recall. I'll add more as I discover (and need) more editing features...

### Multi line select and edit. ###
Highlight some text then use the keyboard combination below to select for simultaneous editing.

MacOS: `Shift` + `Cmd` + `L`

Windows / Linux: `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `L`

### Select cursor on mutliple lines ###
Select a block of multiple lines. Then use the key combination below to put cursors at the end of every line.
MacOS: `Shift` + `Alt` + `I`
